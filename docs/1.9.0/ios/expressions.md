Expressions
---

Rather than pre-calculating the sizes and positions of your shapes, you can get ShapeScript to compute the values for you using *expressions*.

Expressions are formed by combining [literal values](literals.md), [symbols](symbols.md) or [functions](functions.md) with *operators*.


## Operators

Operators are used in conjunction with individual values to perform calculations:

```swift
5 + 3 * 4
```

ShapeScript supports all the standard [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) arithmetic operators:

Symbol         | Name                  | Function
:------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------
&plus;         | plus                  | Adds the left and right values
&dash;         | minus                 | Subtracts the right value from the left value
&ast;          | times                 | Multiplies the left value by the right value
&sol;          | divide                | Divides the left value by the right value
&percnt;       | modulo                | Remainder of dividing the left value by the right value

<br>

Unary + and - are also supported:

```swift
-5 * +7
```

Operator precedence follows the standard [BODMAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Mnemonics) convention, and you can use parentheses to override the order of evaluation:

```swift
(5 + 3) * 4
```

Because spaces are used as delimiters in [vector literals](literals.md#vectors-and-tuples), you need to take care with the spacing around operators to avoid ambiguity. Specifically, unary + and - must not have a space after them, and ordinary infix operators should have balanced space around them.

For example, these expressions would both evaluate to a single number with the value 4:

```swift
5 - 1
5-1
```

Whereas this expression would be interpreted as a 2D vector of 5 and -1:

```swift
5 -1
```

## Equality and Comparison

ShapeScript includes the following equality and comparison operators, which can be used in [conditional logic](control-flow.md#if-else):

Symbol         | Name                  | Function
:------------- | :-------------------- |:--------------------------------------
=              | equal                 | Compares two values and returns `true` if they are equal
<>             | not equal             | Compares two values and returns `false` if they are equal
<              | less than             | Returns `true` if the left value is less than the value on the right
<=             | less than or equal    | Returns `true` if the left value is less than or equal to the right
&gt;           | greater than          | Returns `true` if the left value is greater than the value on the right
&gt;=          | greater than or equal | Returns `true` if the left value is greater than or equal to the right

<br>

**Note:** You may have used other languages where `=` is written as `==`. This is generally because in such languages the `=` operator is used for assignment, and re-using the same symbol would cause ambiguity. This is not a problem in ShapeScript.

While these operators are typically used with numeric inputs, the *output* is a boolean value (`true` or `false`). These values are most commonly used in conjunction with with the `if/else` control flow statement. For example:

```swift
if rnd > 0.5 {
    print "heads"
} else {
    print "tails"
}
```

But they can also be assigned to a symbol and passed around:

```swift
define averageColor (color.red + color.green + color.blue) / 3
define isBrightColor averageColor >= 0.5
print isBrightColor // prints true or false
```

## Linear Algebra

As well as operating on individual numbers, some operators can be used with [vectors or tuples](literals.md#vectors-and-tuples). To multiply or divide a tuple of numbers by a scalar value you can use:

```swift
define numbers (1 2 3 -4)
print numbers * 2 // prints 2 4 6 -8
```

You can also multiply two tuples:

```swift
define left (1 2 3)
define right (1 -2 3)
print left * right // prints 1 -4 9
```

Note that is a simple member-wise multiplication of the numbers. For other types of vector multiplication such as the dot or cross product see the [functions section](functions.md#linear-algebra).

If the tuples have different lengths, the result will be truncated to the shorter of the two:

```swift
define left (1 2 3)
define right (1 -2)
print left * right // prints 1 -4
```

You can also add or subtract two lists of numbers together:

```swift
define left (1 2 3)
define right (1 -2 3)
print left + right // prints 2 0 6
```

Unlike with multiplication or division, adding or subtracting a shorter tuple from a longer one will preserve the length of the left side:

```swift
define left (1 2 3)
define right (1 -2)
print left + right // prints 2 0 3
```

Adding a longer tuple to a shorter one will not widen the result however:

```swift
define left (1 2 3)
define right (1 -2 3 4)
print left + right // prints 2 0 3
```

## Boolean Algebra

Along with the standard arithmetic operators, ShapeScript also has [boolean operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) for implementing logical operations.

Not to be confused with the [boolean geometry](csg.md) functions for working with 3D solids, ShapeScript's boolean operators work with `true` or `false` values, and are predominantly used in conjunction with `if/else` control flow statements.

ShapeScript supports the common boolean operators:

Operator       | Function
:------------- | :--------------------
and            | Compares two values and returns `true` if they are both true
or             | Compares two values and returns `true` if either one is true
not            | Returns `false` if the expression to the right is true, and `true` if it's false

<br>

Unlike some languages, ShapeScript's boolean operators are implemented as keywords rather than symbols like `&&` or `||`, so control flow statements read more like sentences:

```swift
if a and b {
    print "both a and b were true"    
}
```

These can be combined into more complex expressions, and used in conjunction with parentheses for disambiguation:

```swift
if (not a) and (b or c) {
    print "a was false and either b or c were true"  
}
```

## Ranges

Another type of expression you can create is a *range* expression. This consists of two numeric values separated by a `to` keyword:

```swift
1 to 5
```

Ranges are mostly used in [for loops](control-flow.md#loops):

```swift
for i in 1 to 5 {
    print i   
}
```

But they can also be assigned to a [symbol](symbols.md) using the `define` command, and then used later:

```swift
define loops 1 to 5

for i in loops {
    print i // prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

You can also use the `in` operator to check if a range contains a particular value:

```swift
define range 1 to 5

if 2.5 in range {
    print "range contains 2.5"
}
```

**Note:** Ranges are inclusive of both the start and end values, so a loop from `0 to 5` would loop *6* times and not 5 as you might expect.

Range values can be fractional and/or negative:

```swift
for i in 0.2 to 2.2 {
    print i // prints 0.2, 1.2, 2.2
}

for i in -3 to -1 {
    print i // prints -3, -2, -1
}
```

Ranges may also include an optional `step` value to control how the range will be enumerated:

```swift
for i in 1 to 5 step 2 {
    print i // prints 1, 3, 5 
}

for i in 0 to 1 step 0.2 {
    print i // prints 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1
}
```

The step value for an existing range can be set or overridden later:

```swift
define loops 1 to 5 step 3

for i in loops {
    print i // prints 1, 4
}

for i in loops step 2 {
    print i // prints 1, 3, 5 
}
```

A negative `step` can be used to create a [backwards loop](control-flow.md#looping-backwards):

```swift
for i in 5 to 1 step -1 {
    print i // prints 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
}
```

For stepped ranges, `in` will only return true for values that align with the steps:

```swift
define range 1 to 5 step 2

print 1 in range // prints true
print 2 in range // prints false
print 2.5 in range // prints false
print 3 in range // prints true
```

## Partial Ranges

You can create a partial range using the `from` command. Partial ranges have a start value but no end:

```swift
define range from 5

print 4 in range // prints false
print 5 in range // prints true
print 5000 in range // prints true
```

Partial ranges may also have a `step` value:

```swift
define range from 5 step -1

print 0 in range // prints true
print 5 in range // prints true
print 6 in range // prints false
print -5000 in range // prints true
```

## Members

Compound values like [vectors and tuples](literals.md#vectors-and-tuples) and [objects](literals.md#objects) can be decomposed by using the *dot* operator to access individual components or *members*:

```swift
define vector 0.5 0.2 0.4
define yComponent vector.y
print yComponent 0.2
```

Like other operators, the dot operator can be used as part of a larger expression:

```swift
color 1 0.5 0.2
define averageColor (color.red + color.green + color.blue) / 3
print averageColor // prints 0.5667
```

To access members by index instead of name, you can use the ordinal members (`first`, `second`, `third`, ... `last`):

```swift
define vector 0.5 0.2 0.4

print vector.first // prints 0.5
print vector.second // prints 0.2
print vector.last // prints 0.4
```

For strings, you can use the `lines`, `words` and `characters` members:

```swift
define sentence "The quick brown fox"
for word in sentence {
    print word // prints each word on a new line
}
```

For [paths](paths.md) you can access the `bounds` and `points` members. For each point you can access the `position`, `isCurved` and `color`:

```swift
// Print the points in a circle
for point in circle.points {
    print "position: " point.position ", isCurved: " point.isCurved
}
```

For [meshes](meshes.md) you can access the `name`, `bounds`, `volume`, `polygons`, `triangles` and `material` members:

```swift
print cube.bounds.size // prints 1 1 1
print cube.volume // prints 1
print cube.polygons.count // prints 6
print cube.triangles.count // prints 12
```

For [polygons](meshes.md#polygons-and-points) you can get the `bounds` or `center`, use `triangles` to get the triangles that make up the polygon, or use `points` to access the individual vertices. For points you can access the `position` and `color`:

```swift
define triangle polygon {
    color red
    point 0 0
    color green
    point 1 0
    color blue
    point 1 1
}

// Print the vertex positions and colors
for point in triangle.points {
    print "position: " point.position ", color: " point.color
}
```

To access members via a computed name or index, see the [subscripting](#subscripting) section below. For more information about the members that are available to access on various data types, see [structured data](literals.md#structured-data).

## Subscripting

As discussed in the [members](#members) and [structured data](literals.md#structured-data) sections, you can decompose a tuple or other compound value using the dot operator followed by the name or ordinal index of the element you wish to retrieve.

But it is often useful to be able to access a tuple's members using an index that is computed at runtime rather than a hard-coded offset. ShapeScript supports this via a mechanism called *subscripting*.

Using square brackets (`[` and `]`) you can use a string value to access a named member of a value:

```swift
define vector 1 2 3
print vector["y"] // prints 2 - equivalent to vector.y
```

To access an member by its ordinal position, you can use a numeric subscript value instead of a string:

```swift
define vector 1 2 3
print vector[0] // prints 1 - equivalent to vector.first
```

**Note:** subscript indices start at zero, not one. This means that the last available member in a tuple will have an index of `count - 1`:

```swift
define foo 1 2 3 4

// print all the elements of foo
for i in 0 to foo.count - 1 {
    print foo[i]
}
```

To access elements relative to the end of the tuple, you can use negative indices. An index of `-1` is shorthand for `count - 1`:

```swift
define foo 1 2 3 4

print foo[-1] // prints 4
print foo[-2] // prints 3
```

Trying to access tuple elements outside the range `-count to count - 1` will result in an error, as will attempting to access a named member that does not exist. To avoid the error you can check if a given member exists by using the `in` operator, as follows:

```swift
define purple 0.6 0 1

if "red" in purple {
    print "the red value of purple is " purple["red"] // prints 0.6
}
```

You can also use a [range](#ranges) or [partial range](#partial-ranges) of indices to access a subset of a tuple's values':

```swift
define foo 1 2 3 4 5

print foo[0 to 2] // prints 1 2 3
print foo[1 to 3] // prints 2 3 4
print foo[from 2] // prints 3 4 5
```
