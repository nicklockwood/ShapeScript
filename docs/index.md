Overview
---

Welcome to ShapeScript. ShapeScript is a 3D modeling program for people who don't like 3D modeling programs.

Instead of haphazardly dragging polygons and vertices around in a GUI, ShapeScript lets you define your models precisely using code. No artistic skills are required - ShapeScript does all the drawing for you.

The ShapeScript app includes a parser for a simple language (also called "ShapeScript"). ShapeScript (the language) is a cross between a markup language and a programming language.

You don't need to be a programmer to use ShapeScript. If you have ever worked with any kind of structured text like JSON or HTML then it should come naturally. But if you *do* have experience with programming, then you can apply those skills to create even more complex models by using loops, functions and variables to procedurally generate geometry.
